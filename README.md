## Project Overview

We will develop a game, called "Storyquest: Teamwork Prevails", that aims to maximize communication between children who use 
Augmentative and 
Alternative Communication (AAC), and children who communicate verbally. This game will be turn-based, and use pictures to 
encourage communication between two players. We aim to integrate existing AAC technology into this game.

## Project Abstract

This project is a web-based, tablet-friendly "fill-in-the-phrase" story game designed for children, with special considerations 
regarding players who use Augmentative and Alternatve Communication (ACC). In order to promote social inclusion and empathy, the 
game is offered in two modes -External AAC Tablet/Voice Control and Built in AAC Tablet- which provides a turn taken function that 
allows AAC users to communicate without feeling rushed. An embedded or easily accessible AAC-friendly interface ensures minimal 
screen switching and enables easy participation. 
The interface dynamically indicates when a child is composing an answer, fostering understanding and patience among all players. 
Through simple, age-appropriate prompts, lively visuals, and a responsive layout, the game creates an engaging, accessible 
environment that supports the growth of both verbal communicators and children who require additional support. 

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
