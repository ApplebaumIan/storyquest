# System Overview

## Project Abstract

This project is a web-based, tablet-friendly "fill-in-the-phrase" story game designed for children, with special considerations 
regarding players who use Augmentative and Alternatve Communication (ACC). In order to promote social inclusion and empathy, the 
game is offered in two modes -External AAC Tablet/Voice Control and Built in AAC Tablet- which provides a turn taken function that allows AAC users to communicate without feeling 
rushed. An embedded or easily accessible AAC-friendly interface ensures minimal screen switching and enables easy participation. 
The interface dynamically indicates when a child is composing an answer, fostering understanding and patience among all players. 
Through simple, age-appropriate prompts, lively visuals, and a responsive layout, the game creates an engaging, accessible 
environment that supports the growth of both verbal communicators and children who require additional support. 

## Conceptual Design

The website will be built with the Next.js 
Framework primarily for the front-end, and with 
Convex for the back-end. The language 
specifically will be TypeScript and we will 
likely sprinkle in some TailWind CSS. Docusaurus 
and GitHub Pages will keep track of project 
progression. We will use Vercel to seemlessly 
deploy the game.
