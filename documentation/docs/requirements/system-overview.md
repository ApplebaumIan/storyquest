# System Overview

## Project Abstract

This project is a web-based, tablet-friendly "Mad Libs" style story game designed for children to learn how to collaborate, with special considerations 
regarding players who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ACC). In order to promote social inclusion and empathy, the 
game relies on teammates all communicating and working as a team in order to get the phrase correct. This is done so AAC users don't 
feel left behind and are actively needed in the group. An embedded or easily accessible AAC-friendly interface ensures minimal screen switching and enables easy participation. 
The interface dynamically indicates when a child is selecting their answer.

## Conceptual Design

The website was built with the Next.js 
Framework for the front-end, and with 
Convex for the back-end. FireBase was also used for back-end to ensure gaming functionality. We also used TypeScript, TailWind CSS, Motion Library, and ShadCN. Docusaurus and GitHub Pages kept track of project 
progression. Vercel was used to 
deploy the game.

## Background

Many current tools on the market are geared towards engaging AAC users, such as the AAC Language Lab<sup>1</sup> or AssistiveWare<sup>2</sup>.
The AAC Language Lab has web-based games based on stages of learning, and requires a subscription model to use. AssistiveWare has specific apps 
for specific AAC communication devices.  Much of their software apps are targeted towards helping the younger generation of AAC 
users more comfortable with using assistive technology. There is a gap in the market for learning games based in collaboration between AAC users 
and non-AAC users.

StoryQuest aims to create a collaborative environment for AAC and non-AAC users to engage in play. 
In a study by Schwartz et al.,<sup>3</sup> the 31 preschool children with significant developmental disabilities who learned to use Picture 
Exchange Communication Systems to communicate with adults after 11 months, also learned to communicate with peers without disabilities 
after an additional 3 months of intervention in integrated, play-based activities. Social interactions for development remains important 
at the grade-school level.
