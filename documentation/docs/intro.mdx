# Introduction

Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) is any form of communication that is not verbal. Children with AAC can feel socially isolated and left behind.
As a measure against that we have made a story based "Mad Libs" style game centering collaboration. With this game they can keep learning, stay involved, and most importantly have fun!
